ðŸ¤˜ hej! im travis.

an avid outdoorsman, a passionate home-cook, and a child at heart.

i work as a software engineer and have the joy of building gps and mapping apps for fellow outdoors enthusiasts. mostly i work in golang; building out graph data platforms and apis, and high-performance tile serving.

catch me on the trail.
