## the author
ðŸ¤˜ hej! i'm travis.

an avid outdoorsman, a passionate home-cook, and a zealot for good coffee.

i work as a software engineer and have the joy of building gps and mapping apps for fellow outdoors enthusiasts. mostly i work in golang; building out graph data platforms and apis, and tinkering with high-performance map tile serving. i spend a lot of time thinking and talking about concurrency and caching strategies.

catch me on the trail.
