## on my mind

> hope is punk; pass it on.

> do not let selfish men or greedy interests skin your country of its beauty, its riches or its romance.

> the simplicity of solitude is a hard thing to perfect;
> stealing happiness from loneliness is not a simple theft;
> but the black bear has it figured out and gets what he deserves,
> and the fur that he is wearing is the fur that he prefers.
