## on birthdays
i'm not sure why, nor when it began, but for a very long time now, the arrival of my birthday brings a quiet sadness.

i don't *think* it has anything to do with the prospect of aging. tho i'm certainly no fond of the increasing brittleness of my own body.

i don't dwell on mortality. i don't reflect on the previous year with disappointment. 

i really don't know what brings this. but it's here and so am i.

i don't know if it's my aversion to being the center of attention. tho i certainly don't love it. 

i don't know if it's my loneliness with getting birthday texts from my distant friends and family. or my discomfort with the receiving of presents. but thanks anyways for the cookbooks -- i *promise* i will enjoy them; despite the melancholy of this.

i *understand* this all comes from a place of love. but it hasn't made me feel warm and fuzzy in ages.

i don't know if it was the loss of that childhood wonder and excitement with birthdays. tho the change to adulthood certainly felt abrupt.

i think it's the expectation that i *should* feel happy and excited, but do not, which lays the heaviest. why can't i just find joy?
