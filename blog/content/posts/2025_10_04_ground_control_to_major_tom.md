## The best-laid plans of mice and men
about 2 years ago i made a deal with my wife. i wanted to thru-hike the [colorado trail](https://coloradotrail.org/trail/) and then we would try for a kid.

i started training for endurance via gravel biking. i did tons of hiking+backpacking too -- as its a fundamental part of my life -- but the gravel biking is really where i focused on training.

last year i biked more than 2,000 miles and did more than 150,000 feet of climbing. i did completed 7 races which were typically between 70 and 100 miles in length. i was at my lowest weight since covid. i felt so strong.

## often go awry
but i picked up a minor, persistent injury to my hamstring. i calmed down and stopped biking for a bit. it was winter anyways. gave it a few months and things felt fine.

so i went back to hiking -- at least a few miles every day. i felt great and could see me actually completing all 567 miles of the trail this summer.

i started buy new gear -- since i lacked a lot of solo-oriented equipment. because my entire setup was geared towards backpacking with my wife -- but she wasn't going to join and i didn't want to lug the extra weight around.

but through the winter that ache in my hamstring came back. i didn't want to make a big deal of it -- so i toned down the hiking quantity and picked up rock climbing. i figured that would be a fun way to keep exercising and build strength in all those tiny little stabilizing muscels and ligaments that are so easy to injure on the trail.

i had a plan -- this was how i was going to be prepared. i got my boss and hr to sign off -- we were on for departing on the 4th of july.

i was progressing pretty quick with rock climbing -- with all my fitness and strength it was looking like it might be the summer i finally climb the flatirons. things were shaping up!

## on injury
it was the middle of april when i fell. i was doing a warmup climb on a bouldering route in a gym. i was right at the top reaching for the final handhold.

then i was standing on the floor. and my ankle was perpendicular to the floor. i immediately knew thats not how it was supposed to be and i used my leg for leverage and popped it back in the socket. that was it. my plans were toast.

i shattered my ankle at the heel bone. i tore all the ligaments on the outside of my ankle. i partially tore all the ligaments on the inside of my ankle.

i couldn't walk without crutches for two months. i wore a boot every day until july. i've been in physical therapy over 6 months now. and i still can't hike. i don't know if i ever will again.

## on grief
the level of grief i've been going through is hard to explain. it was just an injury. i can walk. i've been doing a 5 mile walks nearly daily for a month now.

but my ankle can't flex like it used to. i can't walk up inclines. i can't hike. i doubt i'll be able to put on a ski boot. i can't drop my ankle to mountain bike.

the grief i feel surely can't compare to loss of life. but it feels like i've lost _me_.

hiking. backpacking. ski touring. mountain biking. those are _just_ hobbies. yet they were the core of _me_. they are fundamental to my being. and i don't know that i can really live without them. can the forest live without the nesting of the birds; the grazing of the deer; the burrowing of the squirrels? maybe -- but it's not a healthy forest to be so devoid of life.

## on hope
there is some hope that it may be fixable with surgery. my physical therapist was able to get some temporary flexibility by disrupting the scar tissue. it was gobsmacking. i had half the flexibility of my good ankle -- but i will take it and take it with zeal.

the scar tissue hasn't shown up in the many rounds of imaging i've gone through. but i am hopeful i can convince a surgeon to do it anyways. what they may view as unnecessary is life-saving to _me_.
