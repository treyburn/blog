## the state of search
so after [yeeting](2025_05_04_my_first_post.md) my blog into the void, i was surprised to find that even after a week i cannot find it on my [favorite search engine](https://kagi.com).

you would think that searching for `travis reyburn blog` would bring us to our illustrious page -- but alas it does not.

well, why not?

as it turns out, even kagi isn't actually an all-knowing oracle. there's a whole messy business required to get your website to rank in search results. they call it search engine optimization[^1]. 

in exchange for being nice to robots crawling the web -- they let our page show up when somebody searches for it. 

in theory. 

mostly, it's gamed nonsense -- there's an entire industry out there to shove their ad riddled website down your throat. the very notion of seo makes me a bit queasy -- but i'd still like folks to have the opportunity to stumble upon this page one day[^2].

## ai
but not all robots are nice. in fact -- it seems that most of the internet traffic is explicitly *not nice*. ai companies are [basically rampaging](https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/) across the web in a never ending thirst for data. 

this website? its future ai slop fodder.

but not all hope is lost. we are the resistance. i have told the ai sloppers to [cram it](https://treyburn.dev/robots.txt) -- and so have many others.

in fact, cloudflare has a bunch of tools to block ai scrapers. and better yet! they have tools to [actively punish](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/) ai crawlers that refuse to behave[^3]. i can't help but giggle at the thought of trapping these bots in an endless labyrinth. may the robots be swift in my annihilation when they take over.

so, of course, i immediately enabled that feature.

## page optimization
in the end -- creating a robots.txt isn't enough. you've got to really gunk up your html if you want search index crawlers to rank it.

frankly, i despise this practice. so -- being the hypocrite that i am -- i let junie handle the enslopification of my site for me[^4].

i have no idea if it works -- but if you ever find this page by accident -- then i guess it must have!

[^1]: although having to do this at all feels rather unoptimized to me.
[^2]: hi mom -- please don't bring this up if you find it lol.
[^3]: but why wouldn't a *non-profit* like openai behave? ðŸ˜‡
[^4]: it only feels appropriate. as a robot -- surely junie is better suited to churning out robot slop settings than me.
